## Discord Bot Commands
Alot of discord bot commands 30+
### How to setup multiple gameservers
1) Go to **Config/config.json** in the directory you extracted Phoenix Backend into.
2) Open it, you should see a **"gameServerIP"** section in the file.
3) To add more gameservers you will have to do it like this `"gameServerIP": ["127.0.0.1:7777:playlist_defaultsolo", "127.0.0.1:7777:playlist_defaultduo"],`
4) You have now added solos and duos to your matchmaking 

## How to start Phoenix Backend
1) Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
2) **Download** and **Extract** Phoenix Backend to a safe location.
3) Run **"install_packages.bat"** to install all the required modules.
4) Go to **Config/config.json** in the directory you extracted Phoenix Backend into.
5) Open it, set your discord bot token **(DO NOT SHARE THIS TOKEN)** and **save it**. The discord bot will be used for creating accounts and managing your account (You can disable the discord bot by entering "bUseDiscordBot" to false in "Config/config.json").
6) Run **"start.bat"**, if there is no errors, it should work.
7) Use something to redirect the Fortnite servers to **localhost:8080** (Which could be fiddler, ssl bypass that redirects servers, etc...)
8) When Fortnite launches and is connected to the backend, enter your email and password (or launch with an exchange code) then press login. It should let you in and everything should be working fine.

## Caldera Service
Recreates a service that is used for the startup of newer Fortnite builds.

### For login
You need to use the **FortniteLauncher.exe** and with that also the **Anti Cheat**

If you use [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler) you can use this script:

```
import Fiddler;

class Handlers
{
    static function OnBeforeRequest(oSession: Session) {

        if (oSession.PathAndQuery.Contains("/caldera/api/v1/launcher/racp"))
        {
            if (oSession.HTTPMethodIs("CONNECT"))
            {
                oSession["x-replywithtunnel"] = "ServerTunnel";
                return;
            }
            oSession.fullUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:5000" + oSession.PathAndQuery
        }
        if (oSession.hostname.Contains("epicgames"))
        {
            if (oSession.HTTPMethodIs("CONNECT"))
            {
                oSession["x-replywithtunnel"] = "ServerTunnel";
                return;
            }
            oSession.fullUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:3013" + oSession.PathAndQuery
        }
    }
}
```

if u change **Caldera Service port** modify this string on **fiddler script**: `oSession.fullUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:urport" + oSession.PathAndQuery`
if u change **Backend port** modify this string on **fiddler script**: `oSession.fullUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:urport" + oSession.PathAndQuery`

After that go to the build folder **(/FortniteGame/Binaries/Win69)** and create a file with the name **launch.bat** or whatever you prefer and insert this code inside it:

```bat
@echo off
set /p code=code: 
start "" "FortniteLauncher.exe" -obfuscationid=WXis54njnKX1MJqoH0uRwdzlbQ1uqQ -AUTH_LOGIN=unused -AUTH_PASSWORD=%code% -AUTH_TYPE=exchangecode -epicapp=Fortnite -epicenv=Prod -EpicPortal -epicsandboxid=fn -noeac -noeaceos -fromfl=be 
```

Launch it, then go to Discord and type **/exchange-code**, copy the code and paste it into the .bat file.
